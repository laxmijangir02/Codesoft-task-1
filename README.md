# To do list
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists

## Features for the To-Do List Application
*Create Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
View Tasks: Users can see all tasks in the list.
Update Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed or update their descriptions.
Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
Save and Load Data: Tasks can be saved to a file, so they persist between sessions.
